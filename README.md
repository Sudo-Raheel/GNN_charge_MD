# GNN_charge_MD

Graph Neural Network for charge-annotated Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
Predicted charges from the GNN will be combined with the LJ potential to account for long range interaction. 
It is a modified approach to NN interatomic potential. Rather than directly training on the Forces and Energies, we are hoping for a boost in accuracy of the LJ potential. 
This approach has the following advantages:
1) Since the Charge Prediction using GNN has been show to work very accurately across different materials. This should act like a universal NN potential with minimal training.
2) Conventional NN potentials perform poorly outside the training regime. Verification and fine-tuning these potentials themselves is a data-intensive task. In the modified LJ approach, a single DFT snapshot and charge analysis can ascertain whether the DFT-level colonic interactions are being properly taken into account.
