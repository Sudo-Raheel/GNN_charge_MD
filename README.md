# GNN_charge_MD

Graph Neural Network for charge-annotated Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
Predicted charges from the GNN will be combined with the LJ potential to account for long range interaction. 
It is a modified approach to NN interatomic potential. Rather than directly training on the Forces and Energies, we are hoping for a boost in accuracy of the LJ potential. 
This approach has the following advantages:
1) Since the Charge Prediction using GNN has been show to work very accurately across different materials. This should act like a universal NN potential with minimal training.
2) Conventional NN potentials perform poorly outside the training regime. Verification and fine-tuning these potentials themselves is a data-intensive task. In the modified LJ approach, a single DFT snapshot and charge analysis can ascertain whether the DFT-level coulombic interactions are being properly taken into account.

## ToDo 
Right now repository contains codes related to GNN for predicting partial charges, Things that are still needed are mentioned below 
1) Strucutre to LJ module needs to be written
2) Code needs to be coupled with a library that can perform MD and is preferably python compatible (potential libraries ase)
